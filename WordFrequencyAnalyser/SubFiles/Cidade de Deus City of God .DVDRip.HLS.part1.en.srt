1
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,400
Damn!The chicken is gone!
Get her,mister!

2
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,720
If the picture is good
I will work in a newspaper.

3
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,480
You are playing with your life
for a photograph?

4
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,120
Do you think that i am in the mood
to see the fucking gang?

5
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,280
The chicken bro!

6
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,840
The chicken i told you,asshole!

7
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,360
Get the chicken!

8
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
If Ze gets you,
you're dead.

9
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
He has to find me first.

10
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,240
Hey,kid!Get the chicken!

11
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,840
-The cops!
-Don't run!

12
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,200
Butthead! Motherfucker!

13
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,920
A photo might
have changed my life. . .

14
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,840
but in the City of God,
if you run you're dead. . .

15
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,280
...if you stay,
you're dead again.

16
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,120
It has always been like that
since i was a kid.

17
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,080
IN THE 60's

18
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,560
-You are so useless.
-Fetch the ball.

19
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,880
Hey, kid! Fetch the ball .

20
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,680
You are not giving it to me?

21
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,960
Fuck you.
What's your name?

22
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,320
Sorry,I forgot to introduce myself.

23
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,720
My name is Rocket.

24
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:30,200
Do not give the ball
to the kid, he stinks.

25
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,960
This is Hairy.

26
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,120
The story of the City of God
starts with him.

27
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:46,360
However, Hairy's story
is connected to Mortes Trio story.

28
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,560
The truck is coming.
Why are you fooling around?

29
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,840
TRIO MORTES STORY

30
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,960
Trio Mortes
the legend of the City of God!

31
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
Hairy.

32
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,400
Snatcher.

33
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,600
And Naive.

34
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,480
With them, Kid and
Benny, Hairy's brother.

35
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:25,800
I did not have enough courage
to go with my brother.

36
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,720
Come Naive!

37
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,880
Let's go!

38
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,120
Stop or I'll shoot,
fucking asshole.

39
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,240
Get out!

40
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,360
Quickly, asshole.
Give me the money!

41
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,280
Who wants gas?

42
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,120
Oh! You wanna die for money
that is not yours?

43
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,400
Lots of money here!

44
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,440
Damn! The cops!

45
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,880
Quickly!
They are everywhere!

46
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,640
Then, I thought that
Trio Mortes. . .

47
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,400
was the toughest gang 
in Rio.

48
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,240
But they were just amateurs.

49
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,040
Even my bro
Naive.

50
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:36,400
Give these to dad
but do not tell him it's from me.

51
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,480
Hairy, come and see what I've got!

52
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,720
We came to the City of God
to find paradise.

53
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,320
Lot of people were homeless
due to the floods...

54
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,400
and the fire
they set in the ghetto.

55
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,520
They are going to bring electricity!

56
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,440
The big bosses however
didn't like the homeless.

57
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,840
Without electricity,without
roads,without buses.

58
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,760
The rich people...
They don't give a damn about us

59
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,200
It has nothing to do
with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards.

60
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,320
Do you think I am going to be
a lifeguard when I grow up?

61
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I don't know.

62
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,080
It is better to be a
lifeguard than a fisherman.

63
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,600
I don't want to be a fisherman,
I will stink.

64
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,560
-Are you insulting your father?
-No.

65
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,960
-What do you want to become?

66
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,560
I sure don't want to be a gangster
or a cop.

67
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,360
I do not want to get killed.

68
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Drop it, kid.

69
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Are you pointing a gun at me?

70
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,680
The kid is with me.

71
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,240
I am a gangster too.

72
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:34,200
-Not many bottles in it.
-We rob trucks every day.

73
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,760
We have to hit a rich
house to get out of here.

74
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,600
No, you have to
follow my plan.

75
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,600
Look who's talking!

76
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,760
He is so stoned, he
doesn't know what he is talking about!

77
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:03,280
You are both not as
worthy as the kid.

78
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,600
What are you thinking, kid?

79
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,280
The gun doesn't make you a robber.
You need ideas.

80
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,600
The kid had ideas.

81
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,240
Is this the Motel?

82
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:26,640
We get the money and leave.
No killings!

83
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
-Give it to me.
-Leave me alone!

84
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,280
Don't you give this
shit to me!

85
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
You're acting like a baby.

86
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,840
-Here's yours.
-Awesome!

87
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:49,560
Do not be hasty. You're staying here
to look out.

88
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,480
If you see cops,
shoot that window.

89
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,520
Why doesn't he stay in the look-out?

90
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,720
This was my plan.
He is good for nothing!

91
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,480
Ok, you had the idea.
But you're just a kid!

92
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,600
Cover us.

93
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,560
Your turn is going to come.
Don't be so hasty.

94
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,000
Stay here.

95
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
This is a hold up, bitch.

96
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:30,720
You should be at school
or at work.

97
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,560
You do not look like robbers.

98
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
Shut up, bitch!

99
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,880
Ok, Snatcher?

100
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
Are we going in?

101
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,520
-I did not order anything.
-It's on the house! Your money!

102
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,120
Take it easy. All I want is your money.

103
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,680
Hey, pal!
What is this mess?

104
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
Are you a church boy?

105
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,280
Give it to me!

106
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
You are old, and ugly.

107
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,880
Do you want to fuck her?

108
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,000
Police! Let's beat it!

109
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:51,920
Take the car.
I'm gonna bring the kid.

110
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,760
-It went wrong. The kid is missing!
-They are shooting, let's go!

111
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,520
-You said you could drive.
-I can, cool down.

112
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Turn! Watch it!

113
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,720
-You asshole!
-I didn't do it on purpose.

114
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,080
No one saw a thing.
Don't say a word, ok?

115
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,600
I twisted my leg!

116
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,160
-Naive is hit!
-It hurts!

117
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,120
Take him to the woods.
I will try to distract the cops.

118
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,400
God help us.

119
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,560
Get the phone.

120
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Shortie. Infamous in the City.
I will talk about him later.

121
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:35,760
It hurts, God dammit!

122
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,160
Shut up!
You're acting like a sissy.

123
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,960
Give me your hand!

124
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,200
A whole car runs
into a bar...

125
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,400
and no one saw a thing?

126
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,120
As always. No one sees,
no one knows a thing.

127
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,160
-What's up, Shortie?
-They are hiding in the woods.

128
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:14,880
I think they 
are hiding in the woods.

129
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
They are in the woods.

130
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,840
Fillipe, lock the car.
Rantzel, come with me.

131
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:38,520
Pitch black.
How do they see?

132
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,240
They stole a fortune
from the motel...

133
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:46,400
-What if we took the money?
-Are you out of your mind?

134
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:51,240
I do not want any trouble.
I just want to eliminate them.

135
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,560
Since when is it a crime
to steal from niggers and robbers?

136
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:00,240
I know a snitch in the City.

137
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:31,480
Did you hear the shootings?
If I find one of them, I will shoot him!

138
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,560
Maracana!
Open the door!

139
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,040
They are after me!

140
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:09,200
The police is after me!
Hide me!

141
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,600
Come inside.

142
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,040
Shit, the cops are
still down there.

143
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,520
-I had a vision, Naive.
-Did you smoke anything?

144
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:34,440
You had a job, right?
How is it? What do they say to you?

145
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,200
I worked for my father.
Fathers say bullshit.

146
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:47,080
I'm leaving. I do not want to die.
I am not meant to be a gangster.

147
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,200
-The cops are down there.
-I don't care.

148
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,000
I am going back to the church.

149
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,840
"I am the resurrection
and the life..

150
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,360
He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live..

151
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,280
And whosoever liveth
 and believeth in me..

152
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,360
shall never die..."

153
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,040
Stop, or I'll shoot!

154
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,400
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead, yet shall he live.."

155
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,400
The robbery in the motel
was the most bloodstained in history.

156
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,040
The gangsters fortunes
changed paths.

157
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,760
He must not have
been a gangster.

158
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,440
He is a worker.

159
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,080
Snatcher was
in God's hands.

160
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,080
Hairy was caught
in the net of Bernice.

161
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,720
and Naive was
in my father's hands.

162
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:11,600
Why are you doing this?
You will be working with me!

163
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,360
Your brother is
going to look after you.

164
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:23,040
If i ever catch you with money
that is not yours, I'll kill you!

165
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,160
This goes for you too.
Put on the work wear!

166
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,360
If your brother is a gangster
you are affected as well!

167
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,040
Don't worry.
He will get over it.

168
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,960
These things are not for you!
You go and study.

169
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,040
Aren't you afraid of being killed?

170
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:56,840
You are smart.
You have to go to college.

171
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,200
I attend school because
I do not like working.

172
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,600
Promise me that you are
never going to touch this weapon.

173
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:16,640
Quickly. I will sell
lots of fish. Do not laugh!

174
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,400
You smiled when father
hit me.

175
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,840
What's wrong?
Cat got your tongue?

176
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,400
I'm thinking how to tell you.

177
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,520
You're gonna fry your brain
if you think so much.

178
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,160
My heart chooses you.
I am listening to my heart.

179
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,080
Are you kidding?

180
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,040
Have you never heard
of love at first sight?

181
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,120
-Gangsters do not love.
-You always talk to me in a bad way.

182
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,720
-Gangsters seduce.
-I am not going to lose my peace.

183
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,120
Gangsters do not stop,
just take a break.

184
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:33,320
-You know nothing of love.
-This is no love, it is a joke.

185
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,280
I love you.

186
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,800
You might convince me
in the end.

187
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:22,000
After the robbery, police
carried out raids in the ghetto.

188
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:32,440
Everyday, someone was sent to jail,
someone was sold out.

189
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,120
But no one ever knew anything.

190
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,640
No one revealed the
robbers' hideout.

191
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,760
THREE MONTHS LATER

192
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:53,840
Why don't you change
life, Hairy?

193
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,960
Find a job instead of
lying in bed all day!

194
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,560
Do you think that a job will
give you money? Go try!

195
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,240
What do you think 
I am doing all day long?

196
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,640
Take it easy, baby.
All I want is you.

197
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,960
To have children, a farm
with chickens, and lots of weed.

198
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,880
I do not believe a word.

199
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,480
I almost got rich
with that robbery.

200
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,840
The police are after you
after the motel killings.

201
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:54,800
What are you saying? Did you see anything?
So, shut up!

202
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,880
They shot them,
and blamed it on me!

203
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,160
They even killed the
Kid! So leave it!

204
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,000
-I don't know who did it
-Not me.

205
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,960
I do not want a gangster as
the father of my children!

206
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,160
You are alone, Hairy!

207
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,360
Snatcher became religious,
Naive found a job.

208
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
-And you?
-I am the same!

209
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,000
-Everybody dumped me.
-Then I will dump you too.

210
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:33,640
I am leaving. If you want, come with
me, or else i will leave alone!

211
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,840
Nice fresh fish!!

212
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,920
My brother promised
to conform.

213
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,680
But the gangster does not change.
Just stops for a while.

214
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,120
Naive was having an affair
with Shortie's wife.

215
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:10,520
I have trout, but for you
I have something special.

216
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,040
It's a mullet.

217
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,520
Does your husband lick you?

218
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,720
Mine, before fucking
he licks me for half an hour.

219
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,400
-From behind? Do you let him?
-No! Doesn't it hurt?

220
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:39,880
In the beginning,yes. After that, it
is perfect! But you need a banana.

221
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,960
-Why?
-You're losing the best part kid!

222
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,480
You warm up a banana
and stick it in your pussy!

223
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:53,280
while he fucks you in the ass.
It is awesome!

224
00:25:53,880 --> 00:26:00,320
-Ask your husband.
-I can't. He will get mad

225
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,960
Try. Men go nuts
for stuff like that.

226
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Fucking nigger!

227
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,880
Bitch!

228
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
Whore!

229
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:29,880
Rocket, give me your
shorts. Quickly!

230
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,680
-I am not gonna get naked in the street.
-Your brother is in danger!

231
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,440
Give me the shirt!

232
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,640
Quickly!

233
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:48,440
I always pay the price.

234
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,920
He ran away.
It's his brother.

235
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,760
I will cut his balls!

236
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,400
Fish! Fresh fish!

237
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,600
Kid, come here.

238
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,880
-Where is your brother?
-Not working today.

239
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,800
-Get in.
-I did nothing.

240
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:26,440
-What about my fish
-Get in. Forget the fish.

241
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,800
My father will
kill me.

242
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,640
Let's go. There is nothing here.

243
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,080
My father sweared not
to see my brother again.

244
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,640
No one saw him again
in the ghetto.

245
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,120
The Trio Mortes story
reaches its end.

246
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,000
Kid! I though you were killed
in the motel.

247
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:13,320
-I can see you got money.
-It's ours, Benny.

248
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,320
Cut the crap
and bring the money.

249
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:25,360
Tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting hard. I'm leaving

250
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,600
But, Shortie was busy

251
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,480
A neighbour called the cops
before sunrise.

252
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,360
The newpapers wrote:

253
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,240
''A husband burries his wife
alive in the City of God''

254
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,360
The place was full of cops.
The robbers ran away.

255
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,680
-Do you want to die?
-Do as I tell you.

256
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,880
Some respect to the lady.

257
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,560
-Let's go.
-There are cops ahead.

258
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:27,360
Fuck them, go away.
Go wherever you want.

259
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,480
What is up?

260
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:34,520
Mercy. It is a piece of crap.

261
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,800
-Start the engine!
-Needs pushing.

262
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,840
Push, Hairy.
Push!

263
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,560
You?

264
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,680
Do you want to arrest
the thieves? There...

265
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,120
Get him!

266
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,560
Run, Hairy!
Stop!

267
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,840
He's a murderer!

268
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,560
The day that Hairy
was killed...

269
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,600
I remember the crowd
and a camera.

270
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,560
I had always wanted a camera.

271
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,600
Let's go to school.

272
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,880
-Why don't we go to the beach?
-We have exams!

273
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,520
So what!
Everybody is at the beach!

274
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,240
She wears bikini
and plays hard to get!

275
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,560
Sun is for everyone.
Beach for a few.

276
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:31,000
IN THE 70's

277
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,880
When I was 16, I bought
my first camera.

278
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,440
Starting from the low.
The cheapest model!

279
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,880
How is it going, Rocket?
Have you been laid yet?

280
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,120
Nothing.

281
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:52,880
Angelica. She drove me mad...

282
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Rocket, are you jerking?

283
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,080
Gorgeus and got laid.
I wanted to lose my virginity with her!

284
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,680
-She has a boyfriend.
-So? I am not jealous

285
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,280
-Her father is a cop.
-No one is perfect.

286
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,560
I was the official photographer
of the gang.

287
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,760
of the "Groovie Gang".

288
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:20,080
Everybody paid for copies.

289
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,880
Siago, move backwards.
There.

290
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,920
I need a joint.

291
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:47,120
Sniff coke.
It is great!

292
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,800
Siago do you sniff?
I prefer good pot.

293
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,360
-I can find some for you if you want.
-Go find then.

294
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:04,400
If we talk about dope,
we talk about coke!

295
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,400
Drugs!

296
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:12,680
-You're full of salt.
-Fuck off.

297
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,800
You want to be a lifeguard
but you never go in.

298
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:21,200
I bet a beer I
am a better swimmer.

299
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,760
If you want, I can find a joint
at Blackies.

300
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,400
I would do anything for her.

301
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,600
I would find pot, coke...

302
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:56,600
I would go to the big ones
to buy good stuff..

303
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:03,880
The boss was an ex
classmate: Blackie.

304
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,760
-Who?
-Rocket!

305
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,040
Who are things going?
The kids ok?

306
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,520
Do you want to buy
or smoke?

307
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,080
Who is it?

308
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,760
This was Blackies hideout.
But not always.

309
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:46,520
Fuck off Kid.
Why are you marching in like that?

310
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,040
Is this your hideout?

311
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,920
THE STORY OF THE HIDEOUT

312
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,880
Dona Zel after becoming a widow
she started to sell drugs...

313
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,680
to feed her children.

314
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,400
She often gave out dope to the
kids in exchange for special favors.

315
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,320
Her favourite was
 the Big Guy.

316
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,600
She was such an amateur
that even Big Guy was cheating on her.

317
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,280
Big Guy was using kids
as dealers.

318
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:25,120
-My pot?
-Stick it in your ass.

319
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,680
The best dealer...

320
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,960
was Redhead.

321
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:35,320
May I have a sip?

322
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,280
Big Guy trusted him

323
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,560
and so he became a manager.

324
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:45,000
Twenty for us.
Five for you, Blackie.

325
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:50,720
One day a friend of Redhead's appeared.

326
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,200
Aristotle.

327
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,280
My wife is sick.

328
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:59,280
His family had helped
Redhead.

329
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,800
He would not refuse help
to a brother.

330
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:08,440
The dope. I want the money
on Friday.

331
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,240
You got me out of jail.

332
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,200
He is a friend, Big Guy.

333
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,800
Give him another week.

334
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,440
You either kill him or I'll kill you.

335
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,320
He had no choice.

336
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:30,600
-I told you on Friday.
-Do not do it friend.

337
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,880
Redhead wanted to get
the Big Guy...

338
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,640
But he did not have to.
Big Guy died in jail.

339
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,640
Redhead took the
belongings of Big Guy...

340
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,440
But not the hideout.
It was cursed.

341
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:55,520
He gave it to his trustee
Blackie.

342
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,840
-One Hundred fifty bags.
-Not enough.

343
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,600
So he took over
the local dealing.

344
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,640
But not for long.

345
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,560
Who is it?

346
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,800
Go see.

347
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:25,200
Fuck off Kid. Why are
you rushing into my hideout?

348
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,360
Who told you
it is yours?

349
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,600
And I am not Kid.
My name is Ze.

350
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,040
THE STORY OF LITTLE ZE

351
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,760
Ze wanted to rule
the City of God...

352
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,720
since he was a kid.

353
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,200
They are having fun and I am not?

354
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,440
I want to go.

355
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,040
What do you want? 
Your friend took it all.

356
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,120
That night, Kid
satisfied his thirst for blood,

357
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,960
knowing that Hairy
would never forgive him.

358
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,360
To save himself,
he left the City of God.

359
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,800
He worked all day for nickels.

360
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,280
Kid and Benny
really made it...

361
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,440
They had the gift of the killer.

362
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
-You have more.
-I had the idea.

363
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,280
The problem was to handle
an older gangster.

364
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,960
Like my brother Goose.

365
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Dammit! I though you died in the motel.
You have lots of money!

366
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,280
It is our money, Benny.

367
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,840
Benny, tell Hairy that
Shortie is getting difficult.

368
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,920
I'm leaving the ghetto.

369
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:27,560
From Hairy.
You are gonna need it.

370
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Robbery after robbery,
the Kid grew big.

371
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:54,200
By the time he was 18, he was the
most respected gangster in the City

372
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,200
One of the most
 dangerous robbers in Rio.

373
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:17,720
Happy Birthday Kid.
Glad you turned 18.

374
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,960
Beat it!

375
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,720
-Just a beer!
-Didn't you see me asshole?

376
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,560
Next time, I will kill
you prick!

377
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:39,040
Kid was ready for everything!

378
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,920
And couldn't wait.

379
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,800
Who is the wealthiest here?

380
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,480
Easy!
Jerry Andriani...

381
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,040
Gold necklace, luxurious clothes.

382
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:57,520
-Perriera and the chick.
-My brother took her.

383
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,000
Look at the ride.

384
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,160
Here is Blackie.
Covered with gold.

385
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:11,360
Redhead. Nice wheels!
All of the dealers.

386
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,000
-All of them wealthy.
-Robberies are shit.

387
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,840
The big money
is in dealing drugs.

388
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,640
-Especially coke.
-Needs capital though.

389
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:25,920
We will kill them
and take it over.

390
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,360
-When do we start?
-Now.

391
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:42,160
The light of Satan
brought you here!

392
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:49,320
Why do you live in the City of God
that God has forgotten?

393
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,800
I know what you want.
You want power.

394
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,560
I have something that will give
you the power you're looking for.

395
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,080
This will change your fate.
I give you my amulet.

396
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:11,080
Just do not fuck
while you wear it...

397
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
because you will die!

398
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:20,560
The kid will no longer be Kid
but Ze.

399
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:23,160
Little Ze grew up.

400
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,960
If you help me,
I will help you.

401
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:41,080
This way, Kid became Ze
and started the killings.

402
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:45,360
One morning
he took over Andriani's gang...

403
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,200
until one night, he ruled
all the ghetto gangs.

404
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:58,960
He did not harm Redhead
since he was Bennie's friend.

405
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,080
Only the hideout was left.
But it was an easy job.

406
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:08,320
Who is it?

407
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,600
Fuck off Kid. Why are you
rushing into my hideout?

408
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,760
Since when is it your hideout?

409
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,840
Anything wrong Kid?

410
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,560
I am not Kid.
My name is Ze!

411
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,800
-You're dead bastard.
-No, he understands.

412
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,000
It's all yours. I want nothing.
I do not want trouble.

413
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:43,440
I had to take vegeance
on my brother's death.

414
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:49,360
You are gonna live,
but you will work for us.

415
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:50,920
Easy to say.

416
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,960
-Where are you going?
-He's clean Ze.

417
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,760
-What is your name?
-Rocket

418
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:03,760
Naive's brother.
Dead Naive's brother.

419
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:11,960
Go and tell everyone
that Ze is now in charge.

420
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,400
We are selling coke.
Got it?

421
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:26,680
Drug dealing is a job too!

422
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,120
The supplier brings the merchantise
which is packed.

423
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,280
It is all a chain.

424
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:41,520
Pot is wrapped.

425
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:48,600
Coke is packed in 10s or 100s.

426
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:53,320
You can be a 
carrier or a drug dealer.

427
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:57,080
The kids start as messengers.

428
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:00,960
Then they do lookouts.

429
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,480
If the cops come,
they all vanish.

430
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,000
Then you become a dealer.

431
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,840
In hard times,
the dealer vanishes.

432
00:46:16,920 --> 00:46:19,000
Growing up,
you become captain.

433
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,200
And if you are good in
math, you become a manager.

434
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,680
Bosses right hand.

435
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,720
The cops get their cut
and stay out of it.

436
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:39,160
Whan Ze came,
all the rivalries stopped in the City.

437
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:41,400
You could go there.

438
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:45,680
Bohemian people bought
their dope safely.

439
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,560
Lots of people became addicts
and Ze became rich.

440
00:46:58,120 --> 00:47:01,600
-Which one should I wear?
-This is cool.

441
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,960
If drug dealing was legal
Ze would be given an Oscar.

442
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,840
I thought that they all
were very dangerous.

443
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,240
However he was everywhere.

444
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:21,040
If I needed pot,
I had to visit Redhead.

445
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,960
-Half a pound.
-Thanks.

446
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:33,800
It was worth it.
I smoked it with Angelica.

447
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:40,760
She had broken up with Siago
and so I made my move.

448
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,040
Fantastic photos.

449
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,440
Do I look good here?

450
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,160
You look good in all of them.

451
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:59,280
Twilight, an empty beach,
a long-lasting kiss..

452
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,680
That was it...

453
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,400
But the Shorties came...

454
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,800
Will you give me a drag?

455
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,800
Here.

456
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,400
See you later.

457
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,440
-Your joint!
-Keep it!

458
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,440
First time I met
the Shorties.

459
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,720
Steak and potatoes.

460
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
-This is for you.
-All of it? Thanks.

461
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:55,440
Do you want to have something to eat?

462
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,800
Can you change the time in the clock please?

463
00:49:01,880 --> 00:49:06,200
After he broke up, Siago
sniffed more and more everyday.

464
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:14,000
When you become an addict, 
you're in the dealer's hands.

465
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,960
-Two bags of ten.
-One bag.

466
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,040
For Siago it was not like that.

467
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,520
-Sorry, godfather.
-Bullshit, did I baptize you?

468
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,400
Give me your bike,
Blackie.

469
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,160
Do you wanna race?

470
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,920
Till the bus.

471
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,240
Ready? Go!

472
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:32,320
-Hard race.
-You're good.

473
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,880
-Where did you buy the trainers from?
-From the neighbourhood.

474
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,840
-And the shirt?
-From the City.

475
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,600
It is an expensive brand.

476
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,240
If I give you the money
will you buy me one?

477
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,200
Shorts and shirt?

478
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:51,960
Buy whatever you can.

479
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,080
-What is your size?
-Measure me!

480
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,040
-With what?
-With you!

481
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,720
Shoe number?
Turn around.

482
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:15,200
-Benny!
-Did you get the goodies?

483
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:22,400
-Just a pair of trousers?
-There is more.

484
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,440
Do you like it?

485
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:34,120
-You have some change.
-Keep it.

486
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,440
This is Benny.

487
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,840
I became bohemian.

488
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:22,720
Gangsters, listen.
Beware...

489
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:28,120
Groovies are making moves
before the big boom.

490
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,240
Fuck you, bastards!

491
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:45,960
Prick!

492
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,320
Redhead is placing
the ghetto in danger.

493
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:10,200
Go talk to him. You can't
just shoot everybody.

494
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:16,400
Don't worry,
the lads here are ok.

495
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,320
I don't worry!

496
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:24,000
Will you dance, Benny? What
happened with the Redhead?

497
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,080
Go talk to him!

498
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:31,040
Benny was the coolest
gangster in the City.

499
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:33,960
He gave away dope,
paid for his drinks.

500
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,200
Ze was the opposite.
He was obsessed.

501
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:41,200
Wanted to become the big ghetto boss.

502
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,160
He was looking for the opportunity
to take over Redhead's gang.

503
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:48,960
Don't let the Shorties
rob the whole ghetto.

504
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:53,160
You mind your business
and I will mind mine.

505
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,120
I'm going for a drink.

506
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,920
How is it going Rocket?

507
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,880
Siago, what's up?

508
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,280
Want to dance?

509
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,200
Can we go to your place?

510
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:30,160
My parents are not home.
You're gonna be alone.

511
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:33,160
Today you can
lose your virginity!

512
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:36,760
Don't shout!
Everyone will hear!

513
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:39,560
You're pretty.

514
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,400
It's ok.

515
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:54,960
I know you are related to
the Shorties.

516
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,280
Do you think I am stupid?
You want my gang?

517
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,680
I just want to talk to you.
You are useless!

518
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,720
The Shorties
are endagering us.

519
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,360
Ask them to cool down.

520
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,240
He lets them plunder
in his ghetto, he's useless.

521
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:18,680
If police come here
we're fucked.

522
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,240
I will do it because I like you.

523
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:25,600
Change his diapers!

524
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:33,160
Tell him that no one
plunders in my ghetto!

525
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:42,320
Shorties do not respect
the ghetto rules.

526
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:47,560
They steal from ordinary people
and rob bakeries.

527
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:58,200
You're stealing from me all the time!

528
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:03,240
However, they didn't know
the city had a new boss!

529
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,800
THANK YOU
FOR PREFERING US

530
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:10,840
The city has become safer
for the inhabitants.

531
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,200
Robberies are rare.

532
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,080
All you have to do is visit Ze.

533
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,760
-Do not touch Shorties
-I don't.

534
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:30,520
-Let's go for a walk
-Together?

535
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,080
Mom, I am going out
with my friends.

536
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,840
I have never tasted a better chicken!

537
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:54,920
-The old man was scared to death!
-You feel sorry for him?

538
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,640
Should we rob a bank
or a supermarket?

539
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:12,000
Bullshit. All the money
is in drug dealing.

540
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,920
You have to start as
a messenger.

541
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:22,960
It is no good. Takes too
much time to be promoted.

542
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:29,120
You have to wait for
an old guy to get killed.

543
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:33,760
I won't wait for anyone to
bite the dust. I'll do as Ze.

544
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,080
Are you talknig about be kid?
The boss is here.

545
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,160
Come back, you tramp!

546
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,680
They run fast!

547
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,160
Anyone else?

548
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,640
You're gonna pay for
the ones who run away.

549
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:13,040
Shall I shoot you
in the arm or the leg?

550
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:17,880
-Choose.
-Hand or leg?

551
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,360
Choose, dammit!

552
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:32,400
-In the hand.
-In the hand, eh?

553
00:58:44,440 --> 00:58:48,720
Let's see about you.
Kill one of them.

554
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:56,080
-I'll do it!
-Beat it! He's gonna do it.

555
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,800
Pick whom you'll kill.

556
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:09,280
-We don't have all day.
-Kill one of them.

557
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,720
Get it over with, Steak.

558
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,920
I want to see if you have the guts.

559
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:34,120
Well done! You did it!
You're one of us. Gimme five.

560
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:44,240
Get up, tramp.
Go back to your shithole.

561
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,760
Stop limping!

562
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:50,840
Tell your friends
no one steals from Ze.
