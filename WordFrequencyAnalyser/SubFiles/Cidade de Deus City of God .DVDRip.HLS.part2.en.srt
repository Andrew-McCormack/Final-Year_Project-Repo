1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,920
While Ze was earning the
respect of the locals..

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,640
Benny was winning
Angelica's heart.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,840
I was still a virgin and broke
I had no other choice.

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,360
THE LIFE OF A SUCKER

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,680
I found a job
in a supermarket.

6
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,120
I was working for just a few nickels.
I wanted to be fired..

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,800
to buy a camera
with my wages.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,000
But my fate
was different.

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,760
The guy from the beach!
Do you still smoke?

10
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,360
Kid!
Pull your shirt.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,680
Is this a thank you?

12
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:01,960
-My compensation?
-Which compensation?

13
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,480
The fucking manager
thought I participated.

14
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:10,440
You are fired
because of violation of duty. Beat it!

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,680
I did not get a dime.

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,520
A message from God.

17
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,200
''Honesty is
punished, sucker.''

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,040
FLIRTING WITH CRIME

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,600
The bus is late.
I should have been at work.

20
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,320
-Hide the gun! Are you mad?
-It's broken.

21
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:02,280
-It is not our fault.
-It is never anyone's fault!

22
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,200
But we pay the price.

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,160
Goodnight, lady.

24
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:18,160
I know him. He lives
in the City. He will recognize us.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,600
It is his boss's
money. He doesn't care!

26
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,160
Aren't you
From the City of God?

27
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,800
Only one shall pay.

28
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:45,040
Study, only this way
 you can leave the ghetto.

29
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,160
-Do you study?
-I attended school and then I joined the army.

30
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,320
I was a good shot.
Then, I found this job.

31
00:02:54,960 --> 00:03:01,240
I have knowledge of karate. If I find a job
elsewhere I will leave the ghetto.

32
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,160
Do you fight?

33
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,520
I am peaceful.
But if I have to..

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,560
And he was going to have to. But I
will talk about Knockout later.

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,840
We are leaving. Bye.

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,840
-I couldn't, he was cool.
-He is Gerson's brother.

37
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,920
Let's go home.

38
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,520
There is only a bakery here.

39
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:43,880
-What are you going to say?
-I don't know! ''Robbery!''

40
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,440
-My phone.
-Prefer soul or groovie?

41
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,840
Nothing again. The girl
was very sexy. She flirted with me.

42
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,120
I couldn't pull the gun,
she was so sweet.

43
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,600
I am lost. How do
 I get to Bara?

44
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,960
"The guy from Sao Paolo
was unlucky", I thought.

45
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,080
That's where we are going too.

46
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,840
You are saving me.

47
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,560
Everybody from
Sao Paolo is a nasty piece of work.

48
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,800
We found the body, officer!

49
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Not a pretty sight eh?

50
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Awesome singer.
I like music. Do you?

51
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,560
You like pot too?

52
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,480
Never tried.

53
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,560
I thought so.

54
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240
-Do you have paper?
-I have some.

55
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,120
I was a professor in rolling joints.

56
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,240
If only I was like that
with girls!

57
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,520
I would not be a virgin still.

58
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:40,160
For a guy from Sao Paolo
you're cool.

59
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,040
What did they kill her with?

60
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,120
With a bat or a rock.

61
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,600
-The kid.
-They did not hurt it.

62
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,080
-How long ago?
-About four hours.

63
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,160
Shall we take it?

64
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,040
The murderer must
be from the City of God.

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,240
Motherfucker!

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,480
You should have killed her in the
 ghetto! Cops are coming!

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,040
It was a mater of honour.
Her parents gave me away.

68
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,760
The place is full of cops
because of you! Asshole!

69
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,760
You punished him enough, Ze.

70
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,640
Whoever kills in my
ghetto, dies.

71
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,040
He had issues, Ze.

72
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,120
Leave the ghetto.
You showed disrespect!

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,600
The snake will bite you,
Benny.

74
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,720
-He was useless.
-A dirty traitor.

75
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,040
I am going for a walk with the girl.

76
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Take care. When
things calm down...

77
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,920
we will deal with
Redhead again.

78
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Get a girlfriend, Ze.

79
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,320
-Do you know what I am thinking?
-That I am sexy?

80
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,400
That too. Do you know
what we can do?

81
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,040
-Make love?
-I am serious.

82
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:09,680
Get out of here.
I hate violence.

83
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,560
-And go where?
-To a farm.

84
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:19,680
We are hippies at heart.

85
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,080
To a farm?

86
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,720
Peace and love?

87
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,840
BENNY'S FAREWELL

88
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,560
Benny was too cool
to be a gangster.

89
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
With his party, he managed
to bring everyone together.

90
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,160
Gangs...

91
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,840
Soul fans...

92
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,600
Religious people...

93
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,240
Some day, I'll go to the church.

94
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
Samba fans...

95
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,560
Groovies...

96
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,600
And Ze
who danced for the first time in his life.

97
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,720
Wanna dance?

98
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,360
-I can't hear you.
-Are you dancing?

99
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,120
Thanks, I got company.

100
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,320
I want to talk to you.

101
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,240
You are no going away
with that chick.

102
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:45,960
I'll live in a farm,
I'll smoke pot, and listen to rock.

103
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,800
Are you going to ruin everything
for a bitch?

104
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,160
She's my girl.

105
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,320
I will kill 
Redhead, the bastard.

106
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,480
You think that everybody is a bastard
that is why I'm leaving!

107
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:07,800
I am your friend but I am leaving.
Try to understand.

108
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,600
I love you but that's all.

109
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,040
Show me your balls man!

110
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,880
You wanna die? Beat it!

111
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,200
Pull your pants down nigger!

112
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:28,200
I wanna see your ass!

113
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,960
Come on you faggot!

114
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,560
Show us your ass!

115
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,920
Put them down!

116
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,120
The camera
for a bag of coke?

117
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,160
-No more shit.
-You're my friend.

118
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,160
-Is it stolen?
-My father's.

119
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,120
-Give it to Ze.
-Rocket will probably want it.

120
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,720
Here I am!

121
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:59,120
You want to be a photographer?
Here's a present.

122
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
Awesome!

123
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,800
Shake your ass!

124
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,920
You're gonna shoot
fine photos.

125
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,320
Bring it here.

126
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,560
-Give me the camera!
-No.

127
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,080
They killed Benny!

128
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,040
Call an ambulance!

129
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
Who the fuck did it?

130
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,120
Ze, Benny is dead.

131
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,560
It's your fault bitch!

132
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,080
-Where is Redhead?
-Blackie's here.

133
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,000
We're fucked.

134
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,640
-Why?
-We're both fucked.

135
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,640
I think I killed
Benny.

136
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,880
Ze is coming. We can
catch up with him in the disco.

137
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:38,760
-Did you kill Benny?
-Accidentally. I aimed at Ze.

138
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:45,960
Blackie, you killed the coolest
gangster in the City.

139
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,480
Without Benny, Redhead
was dead.

140
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,360
We're fucked, man.

141
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:17,880
Where else could a miracle happen
if not in the City of God?

142
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,320
Hello doll.
Gimme a kiss.

143
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,400
Let me pass.
Have you ever seen your face?

144
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,280
All's well baby?

145
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:56,560
It was simple as that.
Ze was ugly.

146
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,480
Knockout Ned
was handsome.

147
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,040
Knockout had whomever he wanted.
Ze had to use violence.

148
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,320
A duel between the good
and charming...

149
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,480
and the bad and ugly.

150
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,600
Let go me!

151
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,280
Enjoy it.

152
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,080
No need to resist.

153
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,960
You are mine now.

154
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,280
Your girlfriend
is hot. Lucky bastard.

155
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,920
I cannot even look at her.

156
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,280
Why didn't the motherfucker
kill me?

157
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,200
Why didn't I kill
the asshole?

158
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
-Let's go back.
-And Redhead?

159
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,080
-We'll be back.
-Are you going to kill him?

160
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,720
Knockout, Come out.

161
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,600
Take it easy.

162
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,520
I am going out. Let go me.

163
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,680
Garson, come back!

164
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,400
None of your business kid.
It is your brother we want!

165
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:22,320
My brother is peaceful!

166
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:26,120
Is he too pretty
to talk to me? Tell him to come out!

167
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,080
He did nothing.

168
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,040
Do you know who I am?
I'm Ze!

169
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,880
Bring the motherfucker!

170
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,400
Cool down, I'll bring him.

171
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,560
I'm hit. Redhead will be
waiting. He asked for it.

172
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,680
The bastard
killed my brother!

173
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,240
I won't let it go.

174
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,800
Need a gun?

175
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,760
-My child!
-Take it easy mom.

176
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:43,120
-Do it right.
-There is no other way.

177
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:48,000
-How could he hit me?
-That's a bad hole.

178
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,160
We were like brothers.

179
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,800
You were hit by one brother
me by the other!

180
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:33,880
Knockout isn't bad.
He came out of nowhere.

181
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,120
You give me a headache, Tuba!

182
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,280
The City of God
found its hero.

183
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:55,960
God bless you.
The kid went looking for trouble.

184
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,360
You did a fine job.
You have to hide.

185
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:12,000
I though Knockout would start
a revolution here.

186
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,400
But God had
other plans.

187
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,080
Steak, where did the
dealers disappear?

188
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,520
They are hiding.
Ze is not in a good mood.

189
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,560
They put us in it
and then they hide.

190
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,840
-Bring me a chocolate.
-I'll try.

191
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,760
Tell her that
Siago is looking for her.

192
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,360
Steak, go tell Redhead. . .

193
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,160
that Ze says if you kill Knockout
he'll leave you alone.

194
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:09,040
-Did you hear this Knockout?
-Get the kid!

195
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:16,560
If you don't stay with us,
you're dead.

196
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:20,520
Come with us.
We'll be partners.

197
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:26,600
I do not like drugs.
It's between me and him.

198
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,960
They are scum. They'd do
anything for power.

199
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,480
Like the Kid here
They are all like robots.

200
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,880
Do you have shit inside your head?

201
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:49,480
Don't you understand that you are
 wasted with this maniac?

202
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,640
You are kiddo!

203
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:00,840
Kid, huh? I sniff. I steal.
I kill. I am man!

204
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:11,080
He is stuck to his gang. Come with us

205
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,120
We will slice you, Steak.

206
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,080
Ok, I accept.

207
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,600
Tell him that Redhead and Knockout
are in charge.

208
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,440
With one condition:
I don't kill innocents.

209
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:37,400
-I won't tolerate it.
-Ok, no innocents.

210
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,360
Steak is fucked up.

211
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,600
-Have you got a gun?
-We'll rob a gun store.

212
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,000
I don't rob anything.
I am not a gangster.

213
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,840
I have something personal with him
I am not a robber.

214
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,400
He raped your girl,
he killed your brother. . .

215
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,760
he hit your house and you
killed a acolyte of his.

216
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:31,840
Unless you are a robber,
get out.

217
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,200
KNOCKOUT NED'S HISTORY

218
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,400
Robbery !

219
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,960
The first time...

220
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,360
Bring the revolvers!

221
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,000
...Knockout Ned saved
a dealer from Redhead.

222
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,280
We said no killings.
It's a rule!

223
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,960
We want the boss' money! Open the register!

224
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,880
Do you want to leave? We also want it.

225
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:23,000
The second time, Redhead
saved Knockout

226
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,480
Ned learned that rules
have exceptions.

227
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,880
An exception .

228
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,920
Are you the director?
Robbery! Everybody down!

229
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,080
I don't play. Whoever moves
will be shot!

230
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,160
The third time,
the exception became a rule.

231
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,600
With the money from the robberies,
they would face Ze.

232
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,720
Redhead would protect his business.

233
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,000
Knockout, the best
shooter, wanted revenge.

234
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,200
The Italian first.
This is 9mm.

235
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,720
-It's not aligned.
-You'll get it at a good price.

236
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,960
This is a 12mm.
We call it ''crap''.

237
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:43,200
Uzi,9mm. From Israel.
David's star.

238
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,680
I want a 30-06.

239
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,520
It's party time!

240
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:55,720
The war begins.
Lets pray.

241
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,280
Our Father,
who art in heaven...

242
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,760
hallowed be thy name...

243
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:21,200
Gangsters have the guns
but they don't shoot.

244
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Knockout's one bullet
was like ten of Ze's bullets.

245
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,200
Ze couldn't stand it.
He attacked.

246
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,520
The ghetto was like Hell
but now it had become Hell!

247
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,120
I decided to get out.
That's how I became a journalist.

248
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,720
Nice picture!
That's Rogerio Ris' for sure.

249
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,400
What was I saying?

250
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,400
As every professional. . .

251
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,800
I started at the lowest level,
from the bottom.

252
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,760
Without knowing
what was ahead of me...

253
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,040
Instead if going home,
I went to the newspaper's offices.

254
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,560
Someone from the City of God
worked at the laboratory.

255
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:17,440
He helped me to fulfill
the dream of my life .

256
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:23,120
Rogerio, this is
Rocket. A photographer.

257
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:27,800
-He is an admirer of yours.
-You have a good taste, Rocket.

258
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,680
I am leaving.

259
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,440
Nice guy!

260
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,240
A personal revenge
lead to war.

261
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,560
The City of God has been divided.

262
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,040
You couldn't
cross it.

263
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,440
Nor to go to a relative.

264
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,400
Those who lived to the ghetto
were considered gangsters.

265
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,160
We were living our own Vietnam. .

266
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:08,200
Volunteers
were giving their lives.

267
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,840
The Kids.

268
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,960
Somebody hit me.

269
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,640
The war
was changing everything.

270
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,320
One of Ze's guys kicked me.

271
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,160
Take this.

272
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,800
He raped my sister...

273
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:28,440
-Ze took our home.
-Kill for your pride.

274
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,720
I am Siago,
Benny's friend.

275
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,880
You know how to read?
Spell?

276
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,680
-I am good.
-You are hired.

277
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,520
To revenge my father's
killer.

278
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,000
-What's your name?
-My name is Oto.

279
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:05,080
What's happening?

280
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,160
-He works.
-He needs a gun.

281
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,080
He won't last a week.

282
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:26,920
A year later, nobody
remembered how it all started.

283
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,640
The aim was, to undertake
enemy's business...

284
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:40,280
to buy guns and to extend
the enterprise.

285
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:06,200
I sniff, I killed, I stole.
I am man!

286
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:32,520
The TV showed interest.
The police would intervene.

287
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,840
A gangster from
the city of God, was arrested.

288
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,200
Manuel Massando
also known as Knockout Ned...

289
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,080
is at hospital after an attack 
of Ze's gang.

290
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,320
He gave us an interview.

291
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,600
-Does the war continue?
-Yes, it continues.

292
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,120
Were many people killed?

293
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,520
Many. Innocent mostly.

294
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:16,400
If a person knows me
that's enough for Ze to kill him.

295
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,280
-Are the police absent?
-They hunt me, not him.

296
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,440
I am in jail while he
kills people without bothering.

297
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,720
Knockout Ned believes
that the war will continue.

298
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,560
Cops promised 
to dislocate the gangs.

299
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:50,840
I am the boss and he is
in the newspaper!

300
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,720
-Did you find mine?
-Knockout's only.

301
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,840
My name must be somewhere.

302
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:02,760
-Can you read?
-The pictures. Nothing.

303
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,120
-What the Hell are you doing?
-Those are the announcements.

304
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,920
Read everything!

305
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,440
-There are no articles!
-Do you want to be shot?

306
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,440
We'll show them
who is the boss!

307
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,440
Give me the camera!

308
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:39,320
-Take a picture .
-I don't know how it works.

309
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,880
Take me. 
Back...

310
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,120
-It doesn't click.
-You fools.

311
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
You fucked me, assholes.

312
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,920
I'll call an acquaintance.

313
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:10,120
He came.
Take the camera.

314
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,760
Well, Kid?

315
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,160
Aren't you a photographer?
Take a picture.

316
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,960
-You broke it.
-Not me.

317
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,120
Needs some fixing.

318
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,080
-What's your name?
-Rocket.

319
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,200
Pull one more.

320
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:52,320
Two lines.
With your guns.

321
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,720
-You're out, Dammit!
-Speak kindly.

322
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:14,720
-Show us the pictures.
-We must develop these photos.

323
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,680
How much does it cost?

324
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:22,720
Take this money
and bring the pictures.

325
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,600
-I have to remove the film.
-No, No. Take the camera.

326
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:32,440
Benny wanted to give it to you.
It is yours.

327
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,560
Don't forget
the pictures.

328
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,440
Can you develop
this film?

329
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,480
I can't, Rocket,
I'll get in trouble.

330
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:04,680
I work only for the newspaper. I'll get fired.

331
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,000
Develop this, Pierre.
And this.

332
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,320
I am going for lunch.

333
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,640
You are lucky.
Dimensions?

334
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,560
For the enlargement.

335
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,200
Whatever you think is best.

336
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,520
I am in big trouble.

337
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,880
I am dead.

338
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,120
Somebody signed
my death sentence.

339
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,800
I would smash his face!

340
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:23,160
You stole my pictures!
 They will kill me!

341
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,120
What are you talking about?

342
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,360
They'll kill me
because of you!

343
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,760
The pictures
were at the laboratory.

344
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,280
Everything that is in the laboratory
is for publication.

345
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,160
-I saw them, I published them.
-You stole them.

346
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,000
-Give them to me.
-Here, take them.

347
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:56,360
-Don't you have more?
-Relax. What's your name?

348
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:02,040
Rocket?
Nice to meet you, Marina.

349
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,000
Relax. I've got your money.

350
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:13,320
When a picture is published
we pay the photographer.

351
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,760
Do you want to become a photographer?

352
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Nice start with a front page!

353
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,160
-How did you take them?
-I live there.

354
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,240
Not even one photographer managed
to go to the ghetto.

355
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:31,960
If you bring more
pictures of Ze. . .

356
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,840
the newspaper will buy them.

357
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,840
-Can you?
-I don't know.

358
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:46,360
-What's the problem?
-I can't go there again at night.

359
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,840
-And the day?
-It is a risk.

360
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:56,560
At last they understand
that I'm the Boss.

361
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,080
What's the name of this photographer
friend of yours?

362
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,680
He is good. I'll take some
to show.

363
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,120
Yes, or not?
It's a big chance.

364
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,320
You made the right decision.

365
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:27,640
I'll give you film, lenses
and another camera.

366
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,520
Come to see the equipment
office.

367
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:36,760
There is another problem also.
Where am I going to sleep tonight?

368
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,920
I can't go back.

369
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:48,320
This one is a 135 mm.
Do you shoot from near or from a distance?

370
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,520
-Can you measure the light?
-Yes.

371
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,080
Don't you think you are too close?

372
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:01,840
I don't know how I managed
to talk to them like this.

373
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,880
Maybe I was about to die
but I had a camera. . .

374
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:10,160
and a chance
to become a photographer.

375
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,400
What is more, we had
the whole night for us.

376
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,440
-Do you want to eat something?
-No thanks.

377
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,320
Won't you eat, or drink?
A joint?

378
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,360
Try this.

379
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,480
Time to sleep.

380
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,920
-I'll show you your bed
-Have you got hot water?

381
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:00,360
Yes, haven't you tried a
hot bath?

382
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:06,240
No. We get boiling water
from the saucepan.

383
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:09,680
-Why are you standing there?
-In which room am I going to sleep?

384
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,560
Unfortunately, I have only one room.
We will sleep together.

385
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,880
I won't tell you much
about my first sexual experience.

386
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,920
Somewhere else, another one, a more important
erotic scene was taking place.

387
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,440
Redhead was helping Knockout
to escape.

388
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,680
without a shot.

389
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:41,120
The guard was in
the hands of the nurse.

390
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:46,200
Meanwhile, Ze
was investing on ammo...

391
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,440
To terminate
Redhead.

392
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,520
He was heavily equipped even though
he didn't have the money to pay.

393
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,120
Did you remember the shotgun? 
It is a semi automatic shotgun.

394
00:44:56,440 --> 00:45:01,720
You haven't seen a Browning like this.
It can even shoot down airplanes.

395
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,560
I want what I asked for.
The American AR-15.

396
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:12,000
-They don't exist in Brazil.
-I don't give a shit.

397
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:21,240
I've got the solution. Ruger
Have you seen this before?

398
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,600
Like the AR-15. Same calibre
but lighter.

399
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,480
With infrared vision ?
400 blasts per minute?

400
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,280
Are you trying to fool me?
I'll fuck you.

401
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,600
Go now. No money.
No guns.

402
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,120
What am I supposed to say to the boss?
-Your problem. Think of something.

403
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,720
Beat it, Fatty

404
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,480
Ze made a big mistake
he didn't know that...

405
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,400
Behind every dealer
there is a big trader.

406
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,960
Did you see this?
Why do they want an AR-15?

407
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,080
They will make investigations
cops. We'll get busted.

408
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:14,600
Do you think that I will betray you?

409
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:21,320
I'll fix it, but
don't get involved again.

410
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:31,440
Charlie! Come here.

411
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,080
Tell him...

412
00:46:38,520 --> 00:46:40,800
Let's go now to the fucking dealer.

413
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,120
Come here, kids.

414
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:00,680
-Do you like chicken?
-It depends.

415
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:06,000
We'll eat chicken and
for dessert...Redhead.

416
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,040
I have a gift for you.

417
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:16,600
-One big for you.
-Are you giving us guns?

418
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,760
Yes, but I want you with me
against Redhead.

419
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,880
-Can we steal later?
-Not in the ghetto.

420
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,160
-Do you know how to shoot?
-More or less.

421
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:33,320
Come to help
the kids!

422
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,000
I know. You do it like this.

423
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:47,480
THE BEGINING OF THE END

424
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,240
Grab the chicken!

425
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:12,000
If Ze catches you,
he'll kill you.

426
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:15,600
He has to find me first.

427
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,000
Kid, grab the chicken!

428
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,440
-The Cops!
-Don't run away!

429
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:53,240
Butthead! Fuckin' faggot!
Get the Hell outta here!

430
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,680
Let them kill 
each other

431
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,120
Rocket!
Take our picture!

432
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,080
Why are you standing there?

433
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:27,320
Kill the motherfucker!

434
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,240
-Relax, don't move.
-It hurts!

435
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,920
Relax, kid!

436
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,160
Why did you join
this fuckin' war?

437
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:21,200
Knockout Ned!
Ze is down!

438
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:25,040
Hang on, I'll help you.

439
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:37,400
-What's your name
-My name is Otto.

440
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,000
I want revenge
for my father's death.

441
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,600
Ze's down!

442
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,520
Hang on.

443
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,640
Cops!

444
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,040
Down! Hands behind your head!

445
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:16,600
-It's you that I want.
-You're through, pal.

446
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,080
Handcuff him.

447
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,720
-Rocket, where are you going?
-I got something to do.

448
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:14,240
We got some arrangements to do, Ze.

449
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,960
Not you. You're the gift
for the Media.

450
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:58,400
-Is it 10,000?
-Almost. That's all I got.

451
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,040
That's all, Boss.
We looked everywhere.

452
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:04,600
Let him go.

453
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:11,200
The ring? Is it gold?

454
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,200
Fuck it.
You owe us the rest.

455
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:23,640
Fuckin' war!

456
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:28,360
Knockout Ned is dead
and I'm broke!

457
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,600
Your fucked, right?

458
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:35,600
We'll do some robberies
to get back my job.

459
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:39,480
-Your job, Ze?
-Is it tough for you, boy?

460
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:43,320
For our friend, motherfucker!
Attack!

461
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,680
We are the Bosses!

462
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,440
That photograph
will make me a professional.

463
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,760
That photograph, will make me famous.

464
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:56,920
Maybe it becomes a frond page
of a magazine.

465
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,360
I won't worry about Ze anymore.

466
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,800
But the police?

467
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:19,280
The Boss of the City
of God, falls down dead...

468
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:23,440
That photograph...
It could kill us.

469
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:27,640
-It gave you work .
-It made me internal.

470
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,000
-You make some money, right?
-Yeah, some...

471
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:37,640
-That journalist? Was she good?
-Good enough.

472
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,640
-You didn't like it?
-How would they know about fucking?

473
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,320
Cocoa stole three houses
at Bara.

474
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:48,880
Let's do him.

475
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,280
-Who killed Roger?
-Bif.

476
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,360
Let's kill the Boss
and Gringo.

477
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,600
It's just the two of us
plus three more...

478
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,560
Have you ever heard
of the Red Brigade?

479
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:07,000
No, but if they come
we'll do 'em.

480
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:09,880
-Who knows how to write?
-Me, a little.

481
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,400
Let's make
a Black List.

482
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:18,000
Add in the List: Nightbird
and Leonard!

483
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:23,040
And the Chinese, he thinks too 
important. Claudio also!

484
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:25,680
Where is Giant?

485
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:44,200
I forgot to tell you,
my name is not Rocket any more.

486
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,960
I'm Wilson Rodriguez.
Photographer.

487
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:50,240
Based on a true story

488
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,200
Manuel Assando also known as
Knockout Ned, was hospitalized...

489
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:15,800
after he was "injured"
by Ze's men.

490
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:17,960
He gave us an interview.

491
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:21,720
Many died.
Mostly innocent.

492
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,800
just for knowing me. . .
just for being my friends.

493
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,880
If someone thinks that
he knows me, he's dead.

494
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:38,240
-Where is the police?
-They're after me, not him.

495
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:45,640
I went three times to jail while
he kills undisturbed.

496
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:49,080
They don't arrest him.

497
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,480
Knockout Ned claims
that the war will be continued.

498
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:55,160
Police officers promised
to take down...

499
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,440
both gangs
in the City of God.
