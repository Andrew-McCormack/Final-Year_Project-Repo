i
believe
in
america
america
has
made
my
fortune
and
i
raised
my
daughter
in
the
american
fashion
i
gave
her
freedom
but
i
taught
her
never
to
dishonor
her
family
she
found
a
boyfriend
not
an
italian
she
went
to
the
movies
with
him
she
stayed
out
late
i
didn
t
protest
two
months
ago
he
took
her
for
a
drive
with
another
boyfriend
they
made
her
drink
whiskey
and
then
they
tried
to
take
advantage
of
her
she
resisted
she
kept
her
honor
so
they
beat
her
like
an
animal
when
i
went
to
the
hospital
her
nose
was
broken
her
jaw
was
shattered
held
together
by
wire
she
couldn
t
even
weep
because
of
the
pain
but
i
wept
why
did
i
weep
she
was
the
light
of
my
life
beautiful
girl
now
she
will
never
be
beautiful
again
sorry
i
went
to
the
police
like
a
good
american
these
two
boys
were
brought
to
trial
the
judge
sentenced
them
to
three
years
in
prison
but
suspended
the
sentence
suspended
the
sentence
they
went
free
that
very
day
i
stood
in
the
courtroom
like
a
fool
those
two
bastards
they
smiled
at
me
then
i
said
to
my
wife
for
justice
we
must
go
to
don
corleone
why
did
you
go
to
the
police
why
didn
t
you
come
to
me
first
what
do
you
want
of
me
tell
me
anything
but
do
what
i
beg
you
to
do
what
is
that
i
want
them
dead
that
i
cannot
do
i
ll
give
you
anything
you
ask
i
ve
known
you
many
years
but
this
is
the
first
time
you
ve
asked
for
help
i
can
t
remember
the
last
time
you
invited
me
for
a
cup
of
coffee
even
though
my
wife
is
godmother
to
your
only
child
but
let
s
be
frank
here
you
never
wanted
my
friendship
and
you
were
afraid
to
be
in
my
debt
i
didn
t
want
to
get
into
trouble
i
understand
you
found
paradise
in
america
you
made
a
good
living
had
police
protection
and
there
were
courts
of
law
you
didn
t
need
a
friend
like
me
but
now
you
come
to
me
and
say
don
corleone
give
me
justice
but
you
don
t
ask
with
respect
you
don
t
offer
friendship
you
don
t
even
think
to
call
me
godfather
you
come
on
my
daughter
s
wedding
day
and
ask
me
to
murder
for
money
i
ask
you
for
justice
that
is
not
justice
your
daughter
is
alive
let
them
suffer
then
as
she
suffers
how
much
shall
i
pay
you
bonasera
bonasera
what
have
i
ever
done
to
make
you
treat
me
so
disrespectfully
if
you
d
come
in
friendship
the
scum
that
ruined
your
daughter
would
be
suffering
this
very
day
and
if
an
honest
man
like
you
should
make
enemies
they
d
be
my
enemies
and
then
they
would
fear
you
be
my
friend
godfather
good
some
day
and
that
day
may
never
come
i
ll
ask
a
service
of

johnny

one
of
woltz
international
s
most
valuable
protð
â
gð
â
s
we
trained
her
for
five
years
singing
acting
dancing
lessons
i
spent
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
on
her
to
make
her
a
big
star
let
me
be
even
more
frank
to
show
you
that
i
m
not
a
hard
hearted
man
that
it
s
not
all
dollars
and
cents
she
was
beautiful
she
was
young
and
innocent
she
s
the
greatest
piece
of
ass
i
ve
had
and
i
ve
had
them
all
over
the
world
then
johnny
fontane
comes
along
with
his
olive
oil
voice
and
guinea
charm
and
she
runs
off
she
threw
it
all
away
just
to
make
me
look
ridiculous
and
a
man
in
my
position
can
t
afford
to
be
made
to
look
ridiculous
you
get
the
hell
out
of
here
if
that
goombah
tries
any
rough
stuff
tell
him
i
m
no
bandleader
yeah
i
heard
that
story
thank
you
for
dinner
and
a
very
pleasant
evening
maybe
your
car
can
take
me
to
the
airport
mr
corleone
insists
on
hearing
bad
news
immediately
you
re
not
too
tired
are
you
tom
no
i
slept
on
the
plane
i
have
the
sollozzo
notes
here
now
sollozzo
is
known
as
the
turk
he
s
supposed
to
be
very
good
with
a
knife
but
only
in
matters
of
business
with
reasonable
complaint
his
business
is
narcotics
he
has
fields
in
turkey
where
they
grow
poppy
in
sicily
he
has
plants
to
process
them
into
heroin
he
needs
cash
he
needs
protection
from
the
police
he
ll
give
a
piece
of
the
action
i
don
t
know
how
much
the
tattaglia
family
is
behind
him
here
they
have
to
be
in
it
for
something
what
about
his
prison
record
one
term
in
italy
one
here
he
s
known
as
a
top
narcotics
man
santino
what
do
you
think
a
lot
of
money
in
that
white
powder
tom
yes
there
s
more
money
in
narcotics
than
anything
else
if
we
don
t
get
into
it
somebody
else
will
maybe
the
five
families
with
that
money
they
can
buy
more
police
and
political
power
then
they
come
after
us
now
we
have
unions
and
gambling
and
that
s
great
but
narcotics
is
the
future
if
we
don
t
get
a
piece
of
that
action
we
risk
everything
in
10
years
time
so
what
s
your
answer
going
to
be
pop
don
corleone
i
need
a
man
who
has
powerful
friends
i
need
a
million
dollars
in
cash
i
need
those
politicians
that
you
carry
in
your
pocket
like
nickels
and
dimes
what
is
the
interest
for
my
family
30
in
the
first
year
your
end
should
be
three
four
million
dollars
and
then
it
would
go
up
and
what
is
the
interest
for
the
tattaglia
family
my
compliments
i
ll
take
care
of
them
out
of
my
share
so
i
receive
30
for
finance
political
influence
and
legal
protection
that
s
right
why
do
you
come
to
me
why
do
i
deserve
this
generosity
if
you
consider
a
million
dollars
in
cash
just

i
said
that
i
would
see
you
because
i
heard
you
were
a
serious
man
to
be
treated
with
respect
but
i
must
say
no
to
you
and
i
ll
give
you
my
reason
it
s
true
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
in
politics
they
wouldn
t
be
friendly
long
if
i
was
involved
in
drugs
instead
of
gambling
which
they
regard
as
a
harmless
vice
but
drugs
is
a
dirty
business
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
to
me
what
a
man
does
for
a
living
but
your
business
is
a
little
dangerous
if
you
re
worried
about
security
the
tattaglias
will
guarantee
it
the
tattaglias
would
guarantee
our
wait
a
minute
i
have
a
sentimental
weakness
for
my
children
and
i
spoil
them
they
talk
when
they
should
listen
but
anyway

the

imagine
the
nerve
of

today
what
did
he
say
what
did
he
say
he
wants
us
to
send
michael
to
hear
the
proposition
he
promises
that
the
deal
is
too
good
to
refuse
and
bruno
tattaglia
that
s
part
of
the
deal
he
cancels
out
what
they
did
to
father
we
should
listen
to
them
no
more
not
this
time
consigliere
no
more
meetings
discussions
or
sollozzo
tricks
i
want
sollozzo
or
we
go
to
war
the
other
families
they
hand
me
sollozzo
this
is
business
not
personal
they
shot
my
father
even
that
was
business
not
personal
then
business
will
have
to
suffer
do
me
a
favor
no
more
advice
on
how
to
patch
things
up
just
help
me
win
i
found
out
about
captain
mccluskey
who
broke
mike
s
jaw
he
s
definitely
on
sollozzo
s
payroll
and
for
big
money
mccluskey
has
agreed
to
be
the
turk
s
bodyguard
so
when
sollozzo
is
being
guarded
he
s
invulnerable
nobody
has
ever
gunned
down
a
new
york
police
captain
all
the
families
would
come
after
you
the
corleone
family
would
be
outcasts
even
the
old
man
s
political
protection
would
run
for
cover
do
me
a
favor
take
this
into
consideration
all
right
we
ll
wait
we
can
t
wait
we
can
t
wait
no
matter
what
sollozzo
says
he
s
going
to
kill
pop
that
s
the
key
for
him
we
ve
got
to
get
sollozzo
mike
is
right
let
me
ask
you
something
what
about
this
mccluskey
what
do
we
do
with
this
cop
they
want
to
have
a
meeting
with
me
right
it
will
be
me
mccluskey
and
sollozzo
let
s
set
the
meeting
get
our
informers
to
find
out
where
it
s
going
to
be
held
we
insist
it
s
a
public
place
a
bar
a
restaurant
some
place
where
there
are
people
so
i
feel
safe
they
ll
search
me
when
i
meet
them
right
so
i
can
t
have
a
weapon
on
me
but
if
clemenza
can
figure
out
a
way
to
have
a
weapon
planted
there
for
me
then
i
ll
kill
them
both
nice
college
boy
didn
t
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
the
family
business
now
you
want
to
shoot
a
police
captain
because
he
slapped
you
this
isn
t
like
the
army
you
have
to
get
close
and
get
their
brains
on
your
suit
you
re
taking
this
very
personal
tom
this
is
business
and
he
s
taking
it
personal
where
does
it
say
you
can
t
kill
a
cop
mikey
i
m
talking
about
a
cop
who
s
mixed
up
in
drugs
a
dishonest
cop
a
cop
who
got
mixed
up
in
the
rackets
and
got
what
was
coming
that
s
a
terrific
story
we
have
newspaper
people
on
the
payroll
right
they
might
like
a
story
like
that
they
might
it
s
not
personal
sonny
it
s
strictly
business
it
s
as
cold
as
they
come
impossible
to
trace
so
you
don

about
the
negotiator
he
s
playing
pinochle
with
my

off
the
negotiator
plays
cards
until
mike
is
back
safe
he
could
blast
whoever
is
in
the

organize
this

and
the
other
heads
of
the
five
families
from
new
york
and
new
jersey
carmine
cuneo
from
the
bronx
and
from
brooklyn
philip
tattaglia
and
from
staten
island
we
have
with
us
victor
strachi
and
the
other
associates
that
came
as
far
as
from
california
and
kansas
city
and
all
the
other
territories
of
the
country
thank
you
how
did
things
ever
get
so
far
i
don
t
know
it
was
so
unfortunate
so
unnecessary
tattaglia
lost
a
son
and
i
lost
a
son
we
re
quits
and
if
tattaglia
agrees
then
i
m
willing
to
let
things
go
on
as
before
we
re
grateful
to
don
corleone
for
calling
this
meeting
we
all
know
him
as
a
man
of
his
word
a
modest
man
who
listens
to
reason
yes
don
barzini
he
s
too
modest
he
had
all
the
judges
and
politicians
in
his
pocket
he
refused
to
share
them
when
did
i
ever
refuse
an
accommodation
all
of
you
know
me
when
did
i
ever
refuse
except
one
time
and
why
because
i
believe
this
drug
business
will
destroy
us
in
the
years
to
come
it
s
not
like
gambling
or
liquor
or
even
women
which
is
something
that
most
people
want
but
is
forbidden
by
the
church
even
the
police
that
have
helped
us
in
the
past
with
gambling
and
other
things
are
going
to
refuse
to
help
us
when
it
comes
to
narcotics
i
believed
that
then
and
i
believe
that
now
times
have
changed
it
s
not
like
the
old
days
when
we
could
do
anything
we
wanted
a
refusal
is
not
the
act
of
a
friend
if
don
corleone
had
all
the
judges
and
politicians
then
he
must
share
them
or
let
others
use
them
he
must
let
us
draw
the
water
from
the
well
certainly
he
can
present
a
bill
for
such
services
after
all
we
re
not
communists
i
also
don
t
believe
in
drugs
for
years
i
paid
my
people
extra
so
they
wouldn
t
do
that
kind
of
business
somebody
says
to
them
i
have
powders
if
you
put
up
3
4
000
dollar
investment
we
can
make
50
000
distributing
they
can
t
resist
i
want
to
control
it
as
a
business
keep
it
respectable
i
don
t
want
it
near
schools
i
don
t
want
it
sold
to
children
thats
an
infð
â
mia
in
my
city
we
would
keep
the
traffic
to
the
colored
they
re
animals
so
let
them
lose
their
souls
i
hoped
that
we
could
come
here
and
reason
together
and
i
m
willing
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
find
a
peaceful
solution
we
are
agreed
the
traffic
in
drugs
will
be
permitted
but
controlled
don
corleone
will
give
us
protection
in
the
east
and
there
will
be
peace
i
must
have
strict
assurance
from
corleone
as
time
goes
by
and
his
position
becomes
stronger
will
he
attempt
any
individual
vendetta
we
are
all
reasonable
men
we
don
t
have
to
give
assurances
you
talk
about
vengeance
will
vengeance
bring
your
son
back
to
you
or
my
boy
to
me
i
forgo
the
vengeance
of
my
son
but
i
have
selfish
reasons
my
youngest
son
was
forced
to
leave
this
country
because
of
this
sollozzo
business
and
i
have
to
make
arrangements
to
bring
him
back
here
safely
cleared
of
all
these
false
charges
but
i
m
a
superstitious
man
if
an
unlucky
accident
should
befall
him
if
he
should
be
shot
by
a
police
officer
or
if
he
should
hang
himself
in
his
jail
cell
or
if
he
s
struck
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
then
i
m
going
to
blame
some
of
the
people
in
this
room
and
that
i
do
not
forgive
but
that
aside
let
me
say
that
i
swear
on
the
souls
of
my
grandchildren
that
i
will
not
be
the
one
to
break
the
peace
we
ve
made
here
today
should
i
insist
that
all
of
tattaglia
s
drug
middlemen
have
clean
records
mention
it
don
t
insist
barzini
will
know
without
being
told
you
mean
tattaglia
tattaglia
s
a
pimp
he
could
never
have
outfought
santino
but
i
didn
t
know
until
this
day
that
it
was
barzini

different
than
any
other
powerful
man
any
man
who
s
responsible
for
other
people
like
a
senator
or
president
how
naive
you
sound
why
they
don
t
have
men
killed
who
s
being
naive
kay
my
father
s
way
of
doing
things
is
over
even
he
knows
that
