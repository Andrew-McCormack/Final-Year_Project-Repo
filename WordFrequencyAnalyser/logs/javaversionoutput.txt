i
believe
in
america
america
has
made
my
fortune
and
i
raised
my
daughter
in
the
american
fashion
i
gave
her
freedom
but
i
taught
her
never
to
dishonor
her
family
she
found
a
boyfriend
not
an
italian
she
went
to
the
movies
with
him
she
stayed
out
late
i
didnt
protest
two
months
ago
he
took
her
for
a
drive
with
another
boyfriend
they
made
her
drink
whiskey
and
then
they
tried
to
take
advantage
of
her
she
resisted
she
kept
her
honor
so
they
beat
her
like
an
animal
when
i
went
to
the
hospital
her
nose
was
broken
she
was
the
light
of
my
life
i
went
to
the
police
like
a
good
american
these
two
boys
were
brought
to
trial
the
judge
sentenced
them
to
three
years
in
prison
but
suspended
the
sentence
i
stood
in
the
courtroom
like
a
fool
those
two
bastards
they
smiled
at
me
why
did
you
go
to
the
police
why
didnt
you
come
to
me
first
what
do
you
want
of
me

me
anything
but

what
i
beg
you

a
cup
of
coffee

wife
is
godmother

only

my
friendship

a
good
living

olive
oil
voice

guinea
charm
and
she

she
threw

look
ridiculous
and
a
man
in
my
position
cant
afford
to
be
made
to
look
ridiculous
you
get
the
hell
out
of
here
if
that
goombah

any
rough
stuff

im
no
bandleader
yeah
i
heard
that
story
thank
you
for
dinner
and
a
very
pleasant
evening
maybe
your
car
can
take
me
to
the
airport
youre
not
too
tired
are
you
tom
no
i
slept
on
the
plane
i
have
the
sollozzo
notes
here
now
sollozzo
is
known
as
the
turk
hes
supposed
to
be
very
good
with
a
knife
but
only
in
matters
of
business
with
reasonable
complaint
his
business
is
narcotics
he
has
fields
in
turkey
where
they
grow
poppy
in
sicily
he
has
plants
to
process
them
into
heroin
he
needs
cash
he
needs
protection
from
the
police
hell
give
a
piece
of
the
action
i
dont
know
how
much
the
tattaglia
family
is
behind
him
here
they
have
to
be
in
it
for
something
what
about
his
prison
record
one
term
in
italy
one
here
hes
known
as
a
top
narcotics
man
santino
what
do
you
think
tom
yes
theres
more
money
in
narcotics
than
anything
else
if
we
dont
get
into
it
somebody
else
will
maybe
the
five
families
with
that
money
they
can
buy
more
police
and
political
power
then
they
come
after
us
now
we
have
unions
and
gambling
and
thats
great
but
narcotics
is
the
future
i
need
a
man
who
has
powerful
friends
i
need
a
million
dollars
in
cash
i
need
those
politicians
that
you
carry
in
your
pocket
like
nickels
and
dimes
what
is
the
interest
for
my
family
in
the
first
year
your
end
should
be
three
four
million
dollars
and
then
it
would
go
up
ill
take
care
of
them
out
of
my
share
so
i
receive
for
finance
political
influence
and
legal
protection
thats
right
why
do
you
come
to
me
why
do
i
deserve
this
generosity
if
you
consider
a
million
dollars
in
cash
just
finance
i
said
that
i
would
see
you
because
i
heard
you
were
a
serious
man
but
i
must
say
no
to
you
and
ill
give
you
my
reason
its
true
i
have
a
lot
of
friends
in
politics
they
wouldnt
be
friendly
long
if
i
was
involved
in
drugs
instead
of
gambling
which
they
regard
as
a
harmless
vice
but
drugs
is
a
dirty
business
it
doesnt
make
any
difference
to
me
what
a
man
does
for
a
living
but
your
business
isa
little
dangerous
if
youre
worried
about
security
the
tattaglias
will
guarantee
it
the
tattaglias
would
guarantee
our
i
have
a
sentimental
weakness
for
my
children
and
i
spoil
them
they
talk
when
they
should
listen
but
anyway

no
is
final

your
new

he
say
he
wants

tattaglia

them
no

not
this
time
consigliere
no
more
meetings
discussions
or
sollozzo
tricks
i
want
sollozzo
or
we
go
to
war
the
other
families
they
hand
me
sollozzo
this
is
business
not
personal
they
shot
my
father
even
that
was
business
not
personal
then
business
will
have
to
suffer
do
me
a
favor
i
found
out
about
captain
mccluskey
who
broke
mikes
jaw
hes
definitely
on
sollozzos
payroll
and
for
big
money
mccluskey
has
agreed
to
be
the
turks
bodyguard
so
when
sollozzo
is
being
guarded
hes
invulnerable
nobody
has
ever
gunned
down
a
new
york
police
captain
all
the
families
would
come
after
you
the
corleone
family
would
be
outcasts
even
the
old
mans
political
protection
would
run
for
cover
we
cant
wait
we
cant
wait
no
matter
what
sollozzo
says
hes
going
to
kill
pop
thats
the
key
for
him
weve
got
to
get
sollozzo
mike
is
right
let
me
ask
you
something
they
want
to
have
a
meeting
with
me
right
get
our
informers
to
find
out
where
its
going
to
be
held
we
insist
its
a
public
place
a
bar
a
restaurant
theyll
search
me
when
i
meet
them
right
nice
college
boy
didnt
want
to
get
mixed
up
in
the
family
business
now
you
want
to
shoot
a
police
captain
because
he
slapped
you
this
isnt
like
the
army
you
have
to
get
close
and
get
their
brains
on
your
suit
youre
taking
this
very
personal
tom
this
is
business
and
hes
taking
it
personal
where
does
it
say
you
cant
kill
a
cop
mikey
im
talking
about
a
cop
whos
mixed
up
in
drugs
a
dishonest
cop
a
cop
who
got
mixed
up
in
the
rackets
and
got
what
was
coming
thats
a
terrific
story
we
have
newspaper
people
on
the
payroll
right
they
might
like
a
story
like
that
its
as
cold
as
they
come
impossible
to
trace
so
you
dont
worry
about
prints
my
ears
i
left
it
noisy
so
it
scares
away
any
painintheass
innocent
bystanders
sit
down
finish
my
dinner
dont
fool
around
let
your
hand
drop
to
your
side
and
let
the
gun
slip
out
everybody
will
still
think
youve
got
it
theyll
stare
at
your
face
so
walk
out
fast
but
dont
run
dont
look
anybody
in
the
eye
but
dont
look
away
either
youll
be
all
right
youll
take
a
vacation
nobody
knows
where
and
well
catch
the
hell
how
bad
do
you
think
it
will
be
pretty
goddamn
bad
all
the
other
families
will
probably
line
up
against
us
these
things
have
to
happen
every
five
years
gets
rid
of
the
bad
blood
been
years
since
the
last
one
you
have
to
stop
them
at
the
beginning
like
they
should
have
stopped
hitler
in
munich
not
letting
him
get
away
with
it
you
know
mike
we
were
all
proud
of
you
being
a
hero
and
all
nothing
not
a
hint
absolutely
nothing
even
sollozzos
people
dont
know
where
the
meeting
will
be
held
how
much
time
do
we
have
theyre
going
to
pick
you
up
outside
jack
dempseys
in
an
hour
and
a
half
we
could
put
a
tail
on
them
sollozzo
would
lose
our
ass
what
about
the
negotiator
hes
playing
pinochle
with
my
men
hes
happy
theyre
letting
him
win
too
risky
maybe
we
should
call
it
off
the
negotiator
plays
cards
until
mike
is
back
safe
he
could
blast
whoever
is
in
the
car
theyll
expect
that
sollozzo
might
not
even
be
in
the
car
sonny
louis
restaurant

my
man

good
american
wife
fabrizio
where
are
you
going
don
barzini
i
want
to
thank
you
for
helping
me
organize
this
meeting
and
the
other
heads
of
the
five
families
from
new
york
and
new
jersey
carmine
cuneo
from
the
bronx
and
from
brooklyn
philip
tattaglia
and
from
staten
island
we
have
with
us
victor
strachi
and
the
other
associates
that
came
as
far
as
from
california
and
kansas
city
how
did
things
ever
get
so
far
were
quits
and
if
tattaglia
agrees
then
im
willing
to
let
things
go
on
as
before
were
grateful
to
don
corleone
for
calling
this
meeting
we
all
know
him
as
a
man
of
his
word
a
modest
man
who
listens
to
reason
yes
don
barzini
hes
too
modest
he
had
all
the
judges
and
politicians
in
his
pocket
he
refused
to
share
them
when
did
i
ever
refuse
an
accommodation
all
of
you
know
me
when
did
i
ever
refuse
except
one
time
and
why
because
i
believe
this
drug
business
will
destroy
us
in
the
years
to
come
its
not
like
gambling
or
liquor
or
even
women
which
is
something
that
most
people
want
but
is
forbidden
by
the
church
even
the
police
that
have
helped
us
in
the
past
with
gambling
and
other
things
are
going
to
refuse
to
help
us
when
it
comes
to
narcotics
i
believed
that
then
and
i
believe
that
now
times
have
changed
its
not
like
the
old
days
when
we
could
do
anything
we
wanted
a
refusal
is
not
the
act
of
a
friend
if
don
corleone
had
all
the
judges
and
politicians
then
he
must
share
them
or
let
others
use
them
he
must
let
us
draw
the
water
from
the
well
certainly
he
can
present
a
bill
for
such
services
i
also
dont
believe
in
drugs
for
years
i
paid
my
people
extra
so
they
wouldnt
do
that
kind
of
business
somebody
says
to
them
i
have
powders
if
you
put
up
dollar
investment
we
can
make
distributing
they
cant
resist
i
want
to
control
it
as
a
business
keep
it
respectable
i
dont
want
it
near
schools
i
dont
want
it
sold
to
children
thats
an
infmia
in
my
city
we
would
keep
the
traffic
to
the
colored
i
hoped
that
we
could
come
here
and
reason
together
and
im
willing
to
do
whatever
is
necessary
to
find
a
peaceful
solution
we
are
agreed
the
traffic
in
drugs
will
be
permitted
but
controlled
don
corleone
will
give
us
protection
in
the
east
and
there
will
be
peace
i
must
have
strict
assurance
from
corleone
as
time
goes
by
and
his
position
becomes
stronger
will
he
attempt
any
individual
vendetta
we
are
all
reasonable
men
we
dont
have
to
give
assurances
you
talk
about
vengeance
will
vengeance
bring
your
son
back
to
you
or
my
boy
to
me
my
youngest
son
was
forced
to
leave
this
country
because
of
this
sollozzo
business
and
i
have
to
make
arrangements
to
bring
him
back
here
safely
cleared
of
all
these
false
charges
but
im
a
superstitious
man
if
an
unlucky
accident
should
befall
him
if
he
should
be
shot
by
a
police
officer
or
if
he
should
hang
himself
in
his
jail
cell
or
if
hes
struck
by
a
bolt
of
lightning
then
im
going
to
blame
some
of
the
people
in
this
room
let
me
say
that
i
swear
on
the
souls
of
my
grandchildren
should
i
insist
that
all
of
tattaglias
drug
middlemen
have
clean
records
barzini
will
know
without
being
told
you
mean
tattaglia
